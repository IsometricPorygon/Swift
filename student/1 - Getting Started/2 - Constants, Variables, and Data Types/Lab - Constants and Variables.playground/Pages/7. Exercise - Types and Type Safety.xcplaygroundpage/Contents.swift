/*:
## Exercise - Types and Type Safety
 
 Declare two variables, one called `firstDecimal` and one called `secondDecimal`. Both should have decimal values. Look at both of their types by holding Option and clicking the variable name.
 */
let firstDecimal: Double = 23.2
let secondDecimal: Double = firstDecimal

//:  Declare a variable called `trueOrFalse` and give it a boolean value. Try to assign it to `firstDecimal` like so: `firstDecimal = trueOrFalse`. Does it compile? Print a statement to the console explaining why not, and remove the line of code that will not compile.
var trueOrFalse: Bool = true
// Will not Compile for Type Safety

//:  Declare a variable and give it a string value. Then try to assign it to `firstDecimal`. Does it compile? Print a statement to the console explaining why not, and remove the line of code that will not compile.
var stringValue: String = " Holden "
// will fail to assign if attempted to convert to Double

//:  Finally, declare a variable with a whole number value. Then try to assign it to `firstDecimal`. Why won't this compile even though both variables are numbers? Print a statement to the console explaining why not, and remove the line of code that will not compile.
var intValue: Int = 32
//intValue = firstDecimal
//Will Not compile for safety reasons
